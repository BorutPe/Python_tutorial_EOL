    "\n",
    "**Extension and Modification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subclasses can extend or modify the behaviors and properties inherited from the superclass. This can be done by adding new methods and attributes or overriding inherited methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**`super()` Function:**\n",

    "- The `super()` function allows the subclass to invoke a method from the superclass, ensuring that the inherited method can be executed even if the subclass overrides it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method Overriding:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- A subclass can provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. This process, known as method overriding, allows the subclass to inherit methods but customize them as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hierarchical Inheritance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python supports hierarchical inheritance, where a subclass can be further subclassed, leading to a hierarchy of classes that inherit properties and behaviors from their ancestors.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inheritance plays a crucial role in enabling polymorphism, where different subclasses can be treated as instances of the same class through their common interface.\n",

    "**Encapsulation:**\n",
